# Why I Chose Libreboot for My KCMA-D8

The journey to complete hardware freedom and why running a librebooted system matters for digital sovereignty.

Digital freedom starts at the firmware level. Every proprietary blob in your system represents a potential backdoor, a piece of code you cannot audit, modify, or trust completely.

The KCMA-D8 motherboard is special - it's one of the few modern high-performance systems that can run completely free firmware. With dual Opteron processors and support for massive amounts of RAM, it doesn't compromise on power.

Libreboot eliminates the Intel Management Engine and AMD Platform Security Processor entirely. No hidden processors running proprietary code with DMA access to your system memory.

The installation process requires patience and precision. You'll need a hardware programmer and steady hands, but the result is complete control over your boot process.

Performance impact? Zero. In fact, Libreboot often boots faster than proprietary firmware because it contains only the code needed to initialize hardware and hand control to your bootloader.

Once running, you know with certainty that every instruction executed by your system is code you could theoretically audit. This peace of mind is worth the extra effort required for installation.

Combined with GNU Guix, the result is a computing stack that respects your freedom from silicon to userspace.
