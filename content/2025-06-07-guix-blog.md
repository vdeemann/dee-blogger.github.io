# Building a Minimal Blog with GNU Guix

Exploring how to create a fast, secure blog using raw HTML/CSS on a librebooted system.

Creating a minimal, fast blog doesn't require complex frameworks or build systems. With raw HTML and CSS served from a GNU Guix environment, you get maximum performance with complete control over every aspect of your content delivery.

The key principles behind this approach are simplicity and efficiency. Every byte matters when you're aiming for sub-3KB pages that load instantly even on the slowest connections. This philosophy respects your readers' time, bandwidth, and devices.

Using Guix's containerized serving approach means your blog infrastructure is completely reproducible and secure. The functional package management ensures you can recreate the exact same environment anywhere, eliminating the classic "works on my machine" problem.

Static HTML files eliminate entire classes of security vulnerabilities that plague dynamic content management systems. No database means no SQL injection. No server-side processing means no remote code execution. No JavaScript frameworks mean no client-side attack vectors.

On a librebooted system with 256GB of RAM, the entire blog exists permanently in memory. Combined with nginx or even a simple Python HTTP server, response times are measured in microseconds rather than milliseconds.

The center-aligned layout with a 40em max-width creates optimal readability across all devices while maintaining the minimal aesthetic. This design choice prioritizes content consumption over flashy visual effects, showing respect for your readers' attention and cognitive load.
