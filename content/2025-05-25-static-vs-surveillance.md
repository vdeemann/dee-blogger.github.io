# Static Sites vs Surveillance Capitalism

Why serving static HTML from your own infrastructure is radical. No tracking, no JS frameworks, no external dependencies.

The modern web is a surveillance apparatus disguised as convenience. Every click tracked, every scroll measured, every pause analyzed to build psychological profiles for advertising manipulation.

Static HTML served from your own infrastructure is a radical act of resistance. No JavaScript analytics, no social media widgets, no external font loading that leaks visitor data to Google.

Content Management Systems create vendor lock-in and security vulnerabilities. WordPress powers 40% of the web and represents 40% of attack surfaces. Static files can't be hacked because there's no dynamic code to exploit.

Bandwidth respect matters. When 4GB of JavaScript loads to display a blog post, you're stealing from users on metered connections. Ultra-minimal sites show respect for your readers' time and data plans.

Search engines prefer fast sites with clean HTML. No need for SEO plugins or optimization tricks when your content loads instantly and parses perfectly.

Hosting becomes trivial. Any web server can serve static files efficiently. No databases, no runtime dependencies, no security patches. Deploy once, run forever.

The environmental impact of bloated websites is staggering. Every unnecessary kilobyte multiplied by millions of page views equals tons of carbon emissions from data centers and devices.

Building this way requires rejecting the narrative that websites must be "interactive" and "engaging." Sometimes the most engaging thing you can do is get out of your reader's way and let them focus on your ideas.
